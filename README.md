## Background
The Modular Indexer, which both includes the [Committee Indexer](https://github.com/RiemaLabs/modular-indexer-committee) and the [Light Indexer](#What-is-Light-Indexer?), establishes a fully user-verified execution layer for Bitcoin's meta-protocols. By harnessing Bitcoin's immutable and decentralized nature, it offers a Turing-complete execution layer that transcends the constraints of Bitcoin's script language.

For a detailed understanding, refer to our paper: ["Modular Indexer: Fully User-Verified Execution Layer for Meta-protocols on Bitcoin"](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/408). Stay updated on the latest progress in our [L1F Discourse Group](https://l1f.discourse.group/t/modular-indexer-fully-user-verified-execution-layer-for-meta-protocols-on-bitcoin/598).

## What is Light Indexer?
`Light Indexer` plays a crucial role in this ecosystem. It retrieves the state of Bitcoin's meta-protocol from `Committee Indexer` according to the user's demand. While ensuring obtained states are trustworthy, it is efficient enough to be executed on browsers, mobiles, and other light devices.

## Getting Started

### 1. Requirements
Before we stepped into the installation, ensure your machine is equipped with the minimum requirements: (Such low configuration requirements are absolutely insane!)

| Metric       | Minimum Requirements     |
|--------------|------------------------- |
| **CPU**      | Single Core              |
| **Memory**   | 512 MB                   |
| **Disk**     | 30 GB                    |
| **Bandwidth**| Upload/Download 100 KB/s |

### 2. Install Dependence
`Light Indexer` is built with Golang. You can run your own `Light Indexer` by following the procedure below.
`Go` version `1.22.0` is required for running repository. Please visit [Golang download Page](https://go.dev/doc/install) to get latest Golang installed. Golang is easy to install all dependence. Fetch all required package by simply running.
```Bash
go mod tidy
```

### 3. Configuration Instructions
To set up `Light Indexer`, begin by copying the example configuration file. Customize it to match your specific requirements.
```Bash
cp ./config/config.example.json config.json
# Add your own bitcoinRPC!
```
[config.example.json](./config/config.example.json) is the initial configuration for the addresses of the official Nubit committee indexers.

#### Detailed Configuration Instructions:
You may add committee indexers settings and Bitcoin RPC settings. Here's a breakdown of what each section in the configuration file means:

##### a. `committeeIndexers` Configuration:
- **Committee Indexers accessible via DA**:
  - `network`: Specify the network for Nubit DA Layer (current, 'Pre-Alpha Testnet').
  - `namespaceID`: The namespace ID used in the DA Layer.
  - `name`: A unique name for your indexer instance.

- **Committee Indexers accessible by S3**:
  - `region`: The AWS region where your S3 bucket is located.
  - `bucket`: The name of the S3 bucket used by the indexer.
  - `name`: A unique name for your indexer instance.

##### b. `bitcoinRPC` Configuration:
- `bitcoinRPC`: Enter the URL of your Bitcoin RPC server for direct blockchain interactions.

##### c. Additional Configurations:
- `metaProtocol`: Define the meta-protocol used (default, 'brc-20').
- `minimalCheckpoint`: Specify the minimum number of checkpoints required for validation.
- `version`: Indicate the version of your `Light Indexer` setup.

### 4. Running the Program
Build and start the Application:
```Bash
go build
./modular-indexer-light
```
_Please note: When initiating the Light Indexer, the system will automatically generate a private key and save it in the 'private' file. Ensure that you securely store this private key._


## Basic Functionality
After successfully launching `Light Indexer`, you have several functionalities at your disposal for interacting with the Bitcoin blockchain. These capabilities can be accessed through the `Indexer Dashboard` or [direct API calls](https://app.gitbook.com/o/CpG1oV8XXLDnYbUdhhqM/s/RvfNFdIQAghhQdWUByGF/developer-guides/introduction):

#### Querying Wallet Balances
`Light Indexer` is capable of fetching the balance of specified Bitcoin wallets, a crucial feature for tracking transactions and managing wallet assets.

#### Accessing and Verifying Checkpoint Data
Working in conjunction with `Modular Indexer (Committee)`, this tool can access and verify checkpoint data for various meta-protocols, ensuring data accuracy and integrity.

`Light Indexer` is optimized for efficiency, requiring minimal resources. This design provides a user-friendly approach for those needing to interact with Bitcoin's meta-protocols without the complexities of in-depth data processing.
