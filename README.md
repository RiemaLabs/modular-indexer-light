***Warning!*** *This release is specifically for the Pre-alpha Testnet and may include changes that are not backward compatible in the future.*

## Background
The Modular Indexer, which both includes the [Modular Indexer (Committee)](https://github.com/RiemaLabs/modular-indexer-committee) and the `Modular Indexer (Light)`, establishes a fully user-verified execution layer for Bitcoin's meta-protocols. By harnessing Bitcoin's immutable and decentralized nature, it offers a Turing-complete execution layer that transcends the constraints of Bitcoin's script language.

The `Modular Indexer (Light)` plays a crucial role in this ecosystem. It acts as a nimble counterpart to the `Modular Indexer (Committee)`, focusing on real-time interaction with the Bitcoin blockchain and validation of data integrity using state-of-the-art cryptographic methods. Even in the presence of adversarial conditions, `Modular Indexer (Light)` ensures reliable and secure connections between Bitcoin and intricate applications such as BRC-20, thus driving the Bitcoin ecosystem's advancement.
